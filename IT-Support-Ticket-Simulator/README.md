# IT Support Ticket Simulator

A realistic IT support ticketing system using GitHub Issues as tickets.

## Overview

This repository uses GitHub Issues to simulate a real IT support ticketing system. Each issue represents one support ticket, allowing you to practice IT troubleshooting, documentation, and ticket management workflows.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Create the GitHub Repository**
   - Go to GitHub and create a new repository named `IT-Support-Ticket-Simulator`
   - Make it public or private (your choice)
   - Do NOT initialize with a README (this repo already has one)

2. **Push This Repository to GitHub**
   ```bash
   cd IT-Support-Ticket-Simulator
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: IT Support Ticket Simulator setup"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/IT-Support-Ticket-Simulator.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Start Creating Tickets**
   - Go to the Issues tab in your GitHub repository
   - Click "New Issue"
   - The ticket template will automatically appear
   - Fill it out with your simulated support scenarios

## How to Use

### Creating Tickets

Each ticket should follow the template format. You can generate tickets by:

1. **Breaking your own system** - Intentionally create problems on your devices
2. **Using common IT scenarios** - Reference typical IT support issues
3. **Using ChatGPT** - Ask ChatGPT to play the role of a confused user reporting issues

### Ticket Workflow

1. **Create Issue** - Use the template to create a new ticket
2. **Initial Assessment** - Document what you think might be happening
3. **Steps Taken** - Log each troubleshooting step
4. **Outcome** - Mark as Resolved, Escalated, or Workaround
5. **Root Cause** - Document the actual cause if discovered
6. **Prevention** - Note what could prevent this in the future

### Labels (Optional)

Consider creating labels for:
- `Priority: High`
- `Priority: Medium`
- `Priority: Low`
- `Status: Open`
- `Status: In Progress`
- `Status: Resolved`
- `Category: Hardware`
- `Category: Software`
- `Category: Network`
- `Category: Account`

## Benefits

- **Free** - No cost for GitHub
- **Realistic** - Mirrors actual IT ticket workflows
- **Trackable** - Full history of all tickets
- **Searchable** - Easy to find similar past issues
- **Portfolio** - Demonstrates IT troubleshooting skills

## Tips

- Be consistent with your ticket format
