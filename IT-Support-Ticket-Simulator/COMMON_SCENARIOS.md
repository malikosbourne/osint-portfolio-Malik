## Tips for Creating Realistic Tickets

1. **Make them vague initially** - Real users often don't provide clear information
2. **Add context gradually** - Update tickets as you gather more information
3. **Include red herrings** - Not all reported symptoms are the actual problem
4. **Mix simple and complex** - Some tickets are quick fixes, others require deep investigation
5. **Document the journey** - Show your troubleshooting process, not just the solution
