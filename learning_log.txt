Day 2 — Coca-Cola Investigation: UK Traffic Light Labelling System

Goal: Investigate selective health policy and corporate transparency in UK nutritional labelling.

Today's Accomplishments:
- Initiated investigation into Coca-Cola's inconsistent use of traffic light nutritional labelling system in UK
- Documented real-world observation: Coca-Cola can without traffic light colour indicators obtained with meal purchase
- Researched post-Brexit regulatory opportunity for UK to mandate traffic light system
- Investigated government inaction despite public health concerns
- Analysed Coca-Cola's marketing psychology and selective transparency practices
- Compiled comprehensive evidence from multiple sources:
  * House of Lords Report on Food, Diet and Obesity (2024)
  * News articles documenting Coca-Cola's initial rejection and later adoption
  * Industry reports on label-less packaging trials
  * Parliamentary and industry criticism of labelling effectiveness
- Documented lack of transparency in adoption rates (no public data on percentage of products using system)
- Established investigation framework with clear objectives, methodology, research questions, and evidence base
- Converted all documentation to British English (Queen's English) spelling
- Created structured investigation document with sections: Objective, Background, Research Questions, Data Sources, Methodology, Findings, Evidence, Analysis, Conclusion, and Resources
- Pushed all work to GitHub repository with detailed commit messages

Key Findings:
- Traffic light system remains voluntary in UK despite post-Brexit opportunity to mandate it
- Coca-Cola's implementation is inconsistent across products (some have labels, some don't)
- When labels are present, they use "one red, three green" pattern minimising negative visual cues
- 2024 label-less packaging trial removed visible nutritional information entirely
- Industry estimates suggest approximately one-third of all UK food products don't use traffic light system
- No public data available on specific percentage of Coca-Cola products using the system
