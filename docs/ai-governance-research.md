# AI Governance Research

Artificial intelligence is advancing at a pace that resembles a modern gold rush. New systems launch rapidly, investment grows aggressively, and the incentives push development forward faster than governance can keep up. This creates a landscape where two truths coexist: AI has extraordinary potential, and it is already causing real-world harm.

AI can enable breakthroughs in medicine, accessibility, efficiency, science, and creativity. At the same time, it is replacing entry-level jobs, amplifying biases, and accelerating misinformation. These are not hypothetical future scenarios—they are observable impacts happening today.

A core issue is the absence of strong, globally aligned guardrails. Major models operate with limited transparency. The public has little visibility into training data, bias sources, or the commercial pressures that shape model behaviour. When technology becomes a source of massive profit, transparency and accountability often disappear. This mirrors previous industrial shifts, where the benefits and the harms were distributed unevenly. A small number of organisations gain significant power and influence, while everyday workers lose the accessible roles that once served as foundations for experience and stability.

AI is not inherently good or bad. Its impact depends entirely on the structures surrounding it: who builds it, who deploys it, who oversees it, and who gets left out of the process. This is why AI governance, ethics, and compliance matter—not as theoretical debates, but as practical frameworks that determine whether technology supports society or undermines it.

## Key Areas That Require Action

1. **Strong, enforceable regulation** — AI development should follow clear legal standards rather than voluntary guidelines. This includes transparent documentation, auditing requirements, external oversight, and consequences for misuse. Regulation should scale with model capability, risk level, and deployment environment.
2. **Mandatory risk assessments** — Before deployment, systems should undergo comprehensive reviews addressing bias and fairness, security vulnerabilities, environmental impact, and social and labour impacts. These assessments must be independent, replicable, and publicly accountable.
3. **Human-centred governance** — AI should augment rather than replace critical human decision making because human judgment provides context, accountability, and ethical grounding that models cannot replicate.
4. **Protection of creative and personal data** — Creators and ordinary individuals deserve meaningful consent regarding how their work or data is used. Training on art, writing, music, photography, or personal data without transparent permission undermines both rights and trust. Clear, simple, opt-in consent frameworks should be a baseline expectation for AI development.
5. **Regulation of AI-driven capitalism** — If companies generate significant profit from public data, public labour, or public-domain content, they must be held to strict standards. Guardrails are necessary to prevent exploitative data practices, monopoly control, extraction of creative labour without compensation, and unchecked commercial influence over public systems.
6. **Bridge roles** — Responsible AI requires people who can understand both the technical and human sides of the technology. These roles bridge innovation and ethics, engineering and policy, and capability and consequence. This interdisciplinary perspective is essential for safe, sustainable development.
7. **A clear long-term strategy** — Society needs a shared plan for where AI should go and what boundaries it should not cross. Allowing technology to advance without this strategy risks outcomes that do not reflect public interest or human values.

## Goal

- Support the development of artificial intelligence that is transparent, accountable, equitable, and aligned with human well-being.
- Encourage responsible innovation rather than unchecked acceleration.
- Help shape a future where technology enhances human life without eroding rights, creativity, labour, or dignity.
