# The Portrait Prompt Series  

### **Module 01 — GRIT & REALISM**



A structured AI prompt toolkit designed to help artists, photographers, and creators produce emotionally authentic portrait images using models like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion.



Most AI portraits lean toward perfection—smooth skin, balanced lighting, flawless symmetry.  

This module intentionally pushes in the opposite direction: toward real skin, imperfect expression, uneven light, and a documentary approach to portraiture.



This project demonstrates:



- prompt engineering structure  

- creative reasoning  

- photographic thinking translated into AI workflows  

- consistency through reusable frameworks  



---

## 🔧 What's Inside



- Dual-format prompts (**quick version + structured version**)  

- Realism-focused portrait language  

- Film simulation terms (Tri-X, HP5, etc.)

- Emotional tone control  

- Space for example outputs and refinement notes  

- Future modules planned as part of a full ongoing series



---

## 📚 Example Prompt Structure



Each entry includes:



- **Quick Copy Prompt**  

- **Structured Prompt**  

- **Example Output Placeholder**  

- Personal commentary (in italics) based on photographic logic



This combines accessibility with depth—use it fast, or use it deliberately.

## ⭐ Contribution & Use

This is currently a personal creative project and portfolio demonstration.  
Future versions may accept:

- community example submissions  
- refinement suggestions  
- additional modules from other photographers or prompt engineers  

---

## 🧩 Intent

This project isn't just a prompt list —  
it's an evolving framework exploring where photography theory and AI image creation overlap.

Real portraiture isn't perfect.

That's the point.
