This project explores where photography theory and AI image generation meet.  

Most AI portraits default to flawless symmetry, perfect lighting, and polished skin — which is visually impressive, but not human.  



This first module focuses on realism, imperfection, and emotional honesty.  

It blends photography language, documentary visual logic, and structured prompt engineering to create repeatable, cinematic portrait outputs with character and grit.



This repository will grow over time into a full series, with each module exploring a different approach to portrait creation.

---

### **Module 01 — GRIT & REALISM**



This project demonstrates:



- prompt engineering structure  

- creative reasoning  

- photographic thinking translated into AI workflows  

- consistency through reusable frameworks  



---

## 🔧 What's Inside



- Dual-format prompts (**quick version + structured version**)  

- Realism-focused portrait language  

- Film simulation terms (Tri-X, HP5, etc.)

- Emotional tone control  

- Space for example outputs and refinement notes  

- Future modules planned as part of a full ongoing series



---

## 📚 Example Prompt Structure



Each entry includes:



- **Quick Copy Prompt**  

- **Structured Prompt**  

- **Example Output Placeholder**  

- Personal commentary (in italics) based on photographic logic



This combines accessibility with depth—use it fast, or use it deliberately.

## ⭐ Contribution & Use

This is currently a personal creative project and portfolio demonstration.  
Future versions may accept:

- community example submissions  
- refinement suggestions  
- additional modules from other photographers or prompt engineers  

---

## 🧩 Intent

This project isn't just a prompt list —  
it's an evolving framework exploring where photography theory and AI image creation overlap.

Real portraiture isn't perfect.

That's the point.
