## Prompts

### Prompt 01: Spontaneous Off-Guard Portrait

**Quick Copy Prompt:**
```
Portrait of someone caught slightly off guard, looking toward camera, 50mm or 85mm prime lens, shallow depth of field, soft natural lighting (overcast or window spill), realistic skin texture with pores and imperfections, unplanned comfortable clothing with natural wrinkles, spontaneous moment, documentary style
```

**Structured Prompt:**
```
A portrait of someone caught slightly off guard, looking toward the camera rather than posing.

Lens simulation: 50mm or 85mm prime with shallow depth of field.

Lighting is soft and natural — overcast or window spill with subtle shadow gradients.

Skin texture remains realistic, showing pores, tonal variation, and small imperfections.

Clothing appears unplanned and comfortable, with natural wrinkles and softness.

The moment feels spontaneous rather than staged, like a frame captured in transition.
```

**Commentary:**
*This prompt prioritizes authenticity over polish. The "off guard" moment creates emotional honesty — when someone isn't fully prepared for the camera, their expression is more genuine. The 50-85mm range mimics classic portrait photography, while shallow depth of field draws focus to the subject's face. Soft, natural lighting avoids harsh shadows that can feel artificial. Realistic skin texture is crucial here; AI defaults to smoothing, so explicitly requesting pores and imperfections pushes against that tendency. The unplanned clothing detail reinforces the documentary approach — this isn't a fashion shoot, it's a moment captured.*

### Prompt 02: End of Day Fatigue Portrait

**Quick Copy Prompt:**
```
Portrait of someone at the end of a long day, relaxed posture, softened energy, naturally tired expression, 85mm lens, shallow depth of field, ambient indoor light or late-day soft natural light, realistic skin with fine lines, under-eye darkness, tonal inconsistency, casual slightly worn clothing, captures fatigue without sadness, honest portrait
```

**Structured Prompt:**
```
A portrait of someone at the end of a long day — relaxed posture, softened energy, and a naturally tired expression.

Lens simulation: 85mm with shallow depth of field.

Lighting is ambient indoor light or late-day soft natural light.

Skin remains real: fine lines, under-eye darkness, and tonal inconsistency are visible.

Clothing appears casual and slightly worn from the day.

The portrait captures fatigue without sadness — just honesty.
```

**Example Output:**
- See: `examples/example-02.jpg`

**Commentary:**
*This prompt explores a specific emotional state that's rarely represented in polished AI imagery: genuine fatigue. The "end of day" framing creates context for the relaxed posture and tired expression — this isn't weakness, it's human reality. The 85mm focal length provides compression that feels intimate without being invasive. Ambient or late-day lighting reinforces the time-of-day narrative and avoids the harshness of midday sun. Explicitly requesting under-eye darkness and fine lines is crucial; AI will default to removing these "flaws," but here they're essential to the story. The distinction between "fatigue without sadness" is important — this isn't depression, it's the honest weariness of someone who's lived their day. The slightly worn clothing adds texture and reinforces the narrative of time passing.*
