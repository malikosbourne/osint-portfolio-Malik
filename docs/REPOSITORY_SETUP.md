# Repository Enhancement Guide

## Making Your Repository Look Better on GitHub

While we can't change the file icons GitHub displays (they're controlled by GitHub's UI), you can enhance your repository's appearance through these settings:

### 1. Add Repository Description

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click the **⚙️ Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to the **"Features"** section
4. In the **"About"** section, add a description:
   ```
   🔍 OSINT Portfolio - Digital investigations, ethical AI research, and data analysis projects
   ```

### 2. Add Repository Topics

1. On your repository's main page, click the **⚙️ Settings** tab
2. Scroll to **"Topics"** section
3. Add relevant topics (tags):
   - `osint`
   - `digital-investigation`
   - `ethical-ai`
   - `data-analysis`
   - `python`
   - `research`
   - `portfolio`
   - `digital-rights`
   - `privacy`

### 3. Add Social Preview Image (Optional)

1. Create a 1280x640px image for your repository
2. Go to **Settings** → **General** → **Social preview**
3. Upload your custom image

This image will appear when sharing your repository on social media.

**Note:** The README.md file icon in the sidebar cannot be changed - it's automatically set by GitHub based on file type. However, these enhancements will make your repository look more professional overall!
