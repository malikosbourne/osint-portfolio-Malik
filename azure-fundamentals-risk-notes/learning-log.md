# Learning Log — Azure Fundamentals (Risk-Aware)

My ongoing log for AZ-900 study and related risk/compliance thinking. I use this to show growth over time — especially when I later add GRC Mastery or similar: *I started here → I refined this*.

## 2026-02-01 — Repo and structure created

**What I studied / did**
- I created `azure-fundamentals-risk-notes` as a public lab notebook.
- I added concepts (shared responsibility, cloud vs on-prem, data residency UK), threat scenarios (misconfigured storage, identity/access failure), governance and a lightweight GRC framework, and my first paper lab (charity cloud risk assessment).

**Key takeaway for risk, compliance, or people**
- I treat AZ-900 as hireable when reframed as risk-aware cloud governance: not just “what is a region?” but “what goes wrong, who gets hurt, and what do I do about it?”
- I use paper labs and decision logs as evidence of structured thinking without needing paid labs.

**What I’ll do next**
- I will work through AZ-900 modules and add notes to `/concepts` or new concept files as needed.
- I will run one AI-assisted scenario (my initial analysis → Cursor critique → my final assessment) and commit to `/assessments`.
- I may start a risk register (e.g. charity or small startup) in `/risk-register`.

**Open questions**
- I’m still figuring out how to keep the learning log concise so it’s useful for me and readable for others.
- When I start GRC Mastery, I need to decide which parts of this repo I update first (frameworks, threat scenarios, labs).
