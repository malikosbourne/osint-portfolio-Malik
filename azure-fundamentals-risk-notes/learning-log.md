# Learning Log — Azure Fundamentals (Risk-Aware)

Ongoing log for AZ-900 study and related risk/compliance thinking. Use this to show growth over time — especially when you later add GRC Mastery or similar: *started here → refined this*.

## 2026-02-01 — Repo and structure created

**What I studied / did**
- Created `azure-fundamentals-risk-notes` as a public lab notebook.
- Added concepts (shared responsibility, cloud vs on-prem, data residency UK), threat scenarios (misconfigured storage, identity/access failure), governance and lightweight GRC framework, and first paper lab (charity cloud risk assessment).

**Key takeaway for risk, compliance, or people**
- AZ-900 becomes hireable when reframed as risk-aware cloud governance: not just “what is a region?” but “what goes wrong, who gets hurt, and what do we do about it?”
- Paper labs and decision logs are evidence of structured thinking without needing paid labs.

**What I’ll do next**
- Work through AZ-900 modules and add notes to `/concepts` or new concept files as needed.
- Run one AI-assisted scenario (initial analysis → Cursor critique → final assessment) and commit to `/assessments`.
- Optionally start a risk register (e.g. charity or small startup) in `/risk-register` or similar.

**Open questions**
- How to keep the learning log concise so it’s useful for me and readable for others?
- When I start GRC Mastery, which parts of this repo do I update first (frameworks, threat scenarios, labs)?
