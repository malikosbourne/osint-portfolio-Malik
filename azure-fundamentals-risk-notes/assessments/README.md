# AI-Assisted Risk Assessments

This folder holds **scenario-based risk assessments** that show:

1. **Human-led initial analysis** — You draft the risk scenario and first pass.
2. **AI-assisted review** — You ask Cursor (or similar) to challenge assumptions, identify missing risks, suggest controls. You capture that output here.
3. **Final assessment** — You critique the AI output and merge your judgement into a final version.

**Why commit all three?**

- **AI literacy** — You show you can use AI as a junior analyst, not a black box.
- **Human judgement** — You show you don’t accept AI output blindly; you critique and correct.
- **Governance maturity** — You document the process so others can see how decisions were made.

That combo is rare and hireable.

## Naming convention

For each scenario, use:

- `[scenario-name]_initial_analysis.md`
- `[scenario-name]_ai_assisted_review.md`
- `[scenario-name]_final_assessment.md`

Example: `charity-migration_initial_analysis.md`, etc.
