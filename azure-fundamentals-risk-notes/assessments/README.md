# AI-Assisted Risk Assessments

This folder holds **scenario-based risk assessments** I run. For each one I:

1. **Draft the initial analysis** — I write the risk scenario and my first pass.
2. **Run an AI-assisted review** — I ask Cursor (or similar) to challenge my assumptions, identify missing risks, suggest controls. I capture that output here.
3. **Write the final assessment** — I critique the AI output and merge my judgement into a final version.

**Why I commit all three**

- **AI literacy** — I use AI as a junior analyst, not a black box; I document that.
- **Human judgement** — I don’t accept AI output blindly; I critique and correct, and I keep the record.
- **Governance maturity** — I document the process so others can see how I made the decisions.

I treat that combo as evidence of how I work.

## Naming convention

For each scenario, use:

- `[scenario-name]_initial_analysis.md`
- `[scenario-name]_ai_assisted_review.md`
- `[scenario-name]_final_assessment.md`

Example: `charity-migration_initial_analysis.md`, etc.
