# What Compliance Misses About Real People

**Short explainer — for LinkedIn / Substack**

Compliance frameworks tell you *what* to do: policies, controls, evidence. They’re weaker on **who actually does it**, **why they might not**, and **who gets hurt when it goes wrong**.

- **Ownership** — “The DPO owns privacy.” In a small org, the DPO is also the COO, the HR lead, and the person answering the phone. Compliance assumes capacity; reality is stretch.
- **Incentives** — Deadlines and funders push for “go live.” Slowing down to do a proper risk intake or access review doesn’t always get rewarded. So people skip it.
- **Harm** — Checklists focus on “did we document?” and “did we notify?” They don’t always force the question: *who was harmed, and could we have prevented it?* Data subjects and beneficiaries stay abstract until something breaks.

That doesn’t mean compliance is useless. It gives you a baseline and something to point to when regulators ask. But if you only tick boxes and never ask “who’s actually responsible?” and “who gets hurt?”, you get **compliance theatre** — paperwork that doesn’t protect people.

**Takeaway for risk and GRC:** Map compliance to *people*: who owns the decision, who does the review, who gets hurt when it fails. Make harm visible in your risk register and in your incident reviews. That’s when compliance starts to protect real people, not just satisfy audits.
