# What Compliance Misses About Real People

**Short explainer — for LinkedIn / Substack**

In my view, compliance frameworks tell you *what* to do: policies, controls, evidence. They’re weaker on **who actually does it**, **why they might not**, and **who gets hurt when it goes wrong**.

- **Ownership** — “The DPO owns privacy.” In a small org, the DPO is also the COO, the HR lead, and the person answering the phone. Compliance assumes capacity; I see reality as stretch.
- **Incentives** — Deadlines and funders push for “go live.” Slowing down to do a proper risk intake or access review doesn’t always get rewarded. So people skip it.
- **Harm** — Checklists focus on “did we document?” and “did we notify?” I find they don’t always force the question: *who was harmed, and could we have prevented it?* Data subjects and beneficiaries stay abstract until something breaks.

That doesn’t mean compliance is useless. I use it as a baseline and something to point to when regulators ask. But if I only tick boxes and never ask “who’s actually responsible?” and “who gets hurt?”, I end up with **compliance theatre** — paperwork that doesn’t protect people.

**What I take from this for risk and GRC:** I map compliance to *people*: who owns the decision, who does the review, who gets hurt when it fails. I make harm visible in my risk register and in my incident reviews. That’s when I treat compliance as protecting real people, not just satisfying audits.
