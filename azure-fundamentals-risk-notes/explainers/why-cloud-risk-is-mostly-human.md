# Why Cloud Risk Is Mostly Human, Not Technical

**Short explainer — for LinkedIn / Substack**

---

Most cloud breaches aren’t caused by magic exploits or provider outages. They’re caused by **who decided what**, and **who didn’t check**.

- **Misconfiguration** — Someone created a storage account with public access, or left the default region, or never turned on MFA. The tech *allowed* it; a human choice (or non-choice) made it happen.
- **Identity** — Phishing, shared passwords, over-privileged accounts. The platform is fine; access and behaviour aren’t governed.
- **Assumption** — “The cloud is secure” or “Microsoft handles it.” Shared responsibility is clear on paper; in practice, nobody read it, so nobody owned the gap.

That doesn’t mean tech doesn’t matter. Encryption, policies, and monitoring reduce the *surface* of human error. But if you only buy tools and never fix **who decides, who reviews, and who gets told**, the same failures repeat.

**Takeaway for risk and GRC:** Invest in decisions and accountability as much as in controls. Document what you decided and why. Assign owners. Review access and config with the same seriousness you give to “did we patch?” — because in the cloud, *configuration is the new patch*.
