# Why Small Orgs Fail Governance Before Tech

**Short explainer — for LinkedIn / Substack**

Small orgs and charities don’t usually fail in the cloud because the tech is too hard. They fail because **governance never got started** — or got started too late.

- **No one owns “risk in the cloud”** — Migration is driven by cost or “we need to modernise.” Nobody is explicitly responsible for “what could go wrong?” and “who decides?” So when something does go wrong, it’s unclear who should have prevented it.
- **No risk intake** — New services and data go into Azure without “what data, where, who has access?” Being asked. Sensitive data ends up in the wrong region or with the wrong permissions because nobody had a gate.
- **“We’re too small for all that”** — Governance gets dismissed as enterprise overhead. So there’s no decision log, no access review, no incident playbook. When an auditor or regulator asks “how did you decide?” or “who had access?”, the answer is “we didn’t document it.”
- **Single points of failure** — One person knows the admin account, the backup, the contract. When they leave or are unavailable, governance and recovery both collapse.

Tech can be fixed with a ticket. **Governance** — who decides, who reviews, who gets told — has to be designed in. Doing it “lightweight” (one owner, one decision log, one playbook) is still doing it. Not doing it is what small orgs regret after the first breach or first audit.

**Takeaway for risk and GRC:** Don’t wait for “when we’re bigger.” Start with one accountable person, one risk intake question, one decision log, one incident playbook. Scale up later. The timeline — “we started here, we improved here” — is itself evidence of maturity.
