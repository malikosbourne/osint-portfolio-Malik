# Explainers

Short pieces for **LinkedIn** or **Substack** — cloud risk, compliance, and governance in plain language. You already think like this; these capture it.

| Piece | One-line pitch |
|-------|----------------|
| [Why cloud risk is mostly human, not technical](why-cloud-risk-is-mostly-human.md) | Misconfiguration and identity failures are human choices; tech alone won’t fix them. |
| [What compliance misses about real people](what-compliance-misses-about-real-people.md) | Frameworks focus on evidence; they’re weaker on who does it and who gets hurt. |
| [Why small orgs fail governance before tech](why-small-orgs-fail-governance-before-tech.md) | Governance never gets started — no owner, no intake, no decision log — so tech fails later. |
