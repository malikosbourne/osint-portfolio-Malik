# Azure Fundamentals — Risk Notes

My **public lab notebook** for AZ-900, reframed through risk, compliance, and governance — risk-aware cloud thinking, not just cloud basics.

## Why I built this

I wanted to document my AZ-900 work in a way that reflects how I think about risk and compliance. This repo is where I keep:

- **Concepts** — What I treat as important for risk, compliance, and people
- **Threat scenarios** — What I see going wrong in real life and who gets hurt
- **Governance** — Frameworks and decision logging I use
- **Paper labs** — Scenario-based assessments (no paid labs; I run these myself)
- **Learning log** — My progress and reflection over time

When I eventually do GRC Mastery (or similar), I will plug what I learn into this structure. The timeline is part of the evidence: *I started here → I refined this → I improved my governance decisions*.

## Structure

| Folder / file | What I use it for |
|---------------|-------------------|
| [concepts/](concepts/) | Core AZ-900 ideas through my risk lens |
| [threat-scenarios/](threat-scenarios/) | Real-world failure modes and impact I track |
| [governance/](governance/) | Basic cloud governance and frameworks I reference |
| [frameworks/](frameworks/) | Lightweight GRC for small UK orgs (my working draft) |
| [labs/](labs/) | Scenario-based risk assessments I run |
| [assessments/](assessments/) | AI-assisted reviews: my initial analysis, AI critique, then my final assessment |
| [risk-register/](risk-register/) | Example risk registers I built (charity, etc.) |
| [explainers/](explainers/) | Short pieces I write for LinkedIn/Substack |
| [learning-log.md](learning-log.md) | My ongoing study and reflection |

## How I structure each note

For each concept and threat note I answer:

1. **What is this?**
2. **Why does it matter for risk, compliance, or people?**
3. **What goes wrong in real life?**
4. **Who gets hurt when it goes wrong?**
