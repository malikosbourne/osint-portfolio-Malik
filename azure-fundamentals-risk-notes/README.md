# Azure Fundamentals — Risk Notes

A **public lab notebook** for AZ-900, reframed through risk, compliance, and governance. Not just “cloud basics” — **risk-aware cloud thinking**.

## Why this repo exists

 This repo shows:

- **Concepts** — What matters for risk, compliance, and people
- **Threat scenarios** — What goes wrong in real life, and who gets hurt
- **Governance** — Basic frameworks and decision logging
- **Paper labs** — Scenario-based investigations (no paid labs required)
- **Learning log** — Progress and reflection over time

3. **What goes wrong in real life?**
4. **Who gets hurt when it goes wrong?**
