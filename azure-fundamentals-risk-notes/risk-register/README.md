# Risk Register (Example)

Fictional but **realistic** risk registers I built for different contexts. I use them as templates and portfolio evidence. They mirror the GRC work I do: Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Controls | Owner.

What I keep here:
- [charity-example.md](charity-example.md) — UK charity with beneficiary data
- *(I may add public-sector-example.md, startup-example.md)*
