# Learning Notes

> **Purpose**: This document serves as my active learning journal. When I use AI assistance, I document what I've learned here to ensure I understand concepts deeply, not just copy-paste solutions. This demonstrates conscious learning and knowledge retention.

## Glossary of Terms & Concepts

### Code & Development

#### **Markdown Syntax**
- **Bold text**: `**text**` → **text**
- **Italic text**: `*text*` → *text*
- **Code blocks**: Triple backticks (```) for multi-line code
- **Inline code**: Single backticks (`) for short code snippets
- **Headers**: `#` for H1, `##` for H2, etc.
- **Links**: `[text](url)` format
- **Lists**: `-` or `*` for unordered, numbers for ordered

#### **Git & Version Control**
- **Repository (repo)**: A folder containing your project files and version history
- **Commit**: A snapshot of your project at a specific point in time
- **Push**: Uploading your local commits to GitHub
- **Pull**: Downloading changes from GitHub to your local machine
- **Branch**: A parallel version of your code (like a separate timeline)

#### **File Extensions**
- `.md` = Markdown file (formatted text)
- `.txt` = Plain text file
- `.ipynb` = Jupyter Notebook (interactive code/documentation)
- `.py` = Python script
- `.sh` = Shell script

### OSINT & Investigation

#### **OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)**
- Information gathered from publicly available sources
- Used for investigations, research, and analysis
- Sources include: websites, social media, public records, news articles
