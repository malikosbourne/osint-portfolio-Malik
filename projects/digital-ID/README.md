## Background
[Add background information about what you're investigating]

### Digital Citizen
The term "digital citizen" refers to individuals who participate in society using digital technologies and platforms. As digital ID systems become more prevalent, understanding what it means to be a digital citizen—and who gets excluded from this status—is crucial to understanding the broader implications of digital identity systems.

### Adaptation: Prosperity vs. Survival
A critical question emerges: Are people adapting to technology and AI out of genuine opportunity and job prosperity, or out of necessity for survival? There's growing concern that adaptation is becoming less about choice and more about avoiding being left behind. Those who cannot or choose not to adapt to digital systems may face exclusion from essential services, employment opportunities, and social participation—effectively suffering the consequences of being left behind in an increasingly digitized world.
