[00:00 → 00:13]  CJ
[00:30 → 00:44]  Beautiful things, beautiful people.
[00:44 → 00:50]  This is what it's all about.
[00:50 → 00:53]  If you think the world looks good, guess what?
[00:53 → 00:59]  It does.
[00:59 → 01:06]  The Arctic turn travels an average of 71,000 kilometers a year.
[01:06 → 01:13]  And though fish are not animals, they do have feeling.
[01:13 → 01:28]  So think about that the next time you take a shit in the sea.
[01:28 → 01:31]  I have no obligation to say I love you if you say you love me.
[01:31 → 01:33]  It's not my fault you love me.
[01:33 → 01:37]  It's not anybody's fault that love is the only thought and pain is the only feeling.
[01:37 → 01:48]  If you ask me that doesn't sound like such a bad situation.
[01:48 → 01:50]  Existence is innocent.
[01:50 → 01:52]  Please don't try to think otherwise.
[01:52 → 02:01]  I was so charged to the game and blame it on the DJ that fell asleep at the decks.
[02:01 → 02:04]  At this point I feel like I'm almost 100% pure angel.
[02:04 → 02:09]  My history starts right now and I'm sorry for being late again.
[02:09 → 02:17]  I just didn't know I had to be on time every single time.
[02:17 → 02:22]  I really did love you and I'm sorry that we couldn't make it work.
[02:22 → 02:28]  I wish you all the best in your life and I'm sorry for always trying to see the funny side.
[02:28 → 02:37]  It just made everything in my life easier.
[02:37 → 02:42]  People need to stop trying to be cool and they need to start trying to be hot.
[02:42 → 02:57]  As you remember, the enemy is your self posed as a question.
[02:57 → 03:06]  I don't know much about anything really but I do know how life makes me feel.
[03:06 → 03:11]  It makes me feel both dead and alive just not at the same time.
[03:11 → 03:14]  But you know what the weirdest part is?
[03:14 → 03:17]  Of all the onions in the world I like to spring onions the best.
[03:17 → 03:26]  They give me hope.
[03:26 → 03:34]  Everything I said was true, apart from that last part.
[03:34 → 03:39]  And although the head hurts,
[03:39 → 03:46]  the heart knows the truth.
