CJ

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:44,380
Beautiful things, beautiful people.

3
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:50,039
This is what it's all about.

4
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,719
If you think the world looks good, guess what?

5
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:59,560
It does.

6
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:06,280
The Arctic turn travels an average of 71,000 kilometers a year.

7
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:13,879
And though fish are not animals, they do have feeling.

8
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:28,480
So think about that the next time you take a shit in the sea.

9
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,680
I have no obligation to say I love you if you say you love me.

10
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,359
It's not my fault you love me.

11
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,760
It's not anybody's fault that love is the only thought and pain is the only feeling.

12
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:48,320
If you ask me that doesn't sound like such a bad situation.

13
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,080
Existence is innocent.

14
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,800
Please don't try to think otherwise.

15
00:01:52,799 --> 00:02:01,120
I was so charged to the game and blame it on the DJ that fell asleep at the decks.

16
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,719
At this point I feel like I'm almost 100% pure angel.

17
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,000
My history starts right now and I'm sorry for being late again.

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,319
I just didn't know I had to be on time every single time.

19
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:22,159
I really did love you and I'm sorry that we couldn't make it work.

20
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:28,159
I wish you all the best in your life and I'm sorry for always trying to see the funny side.

21
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:37,159
It just made everything in my life easier.

22
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:42,039
People need to stop trying to be cool and they need to start trying to be hot.

23
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:57,039
As you remember, the enemy is your self posed as a question.

24
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:06,039
I don't know much about anything really but I do know how life makes me feel.

25
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:11,039
It makes me feel both dead and alive just not at the same time.

26
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,039
But you know what the weirdest part is?

27
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:17,039
Of all the onions in the world I like to spring onions the best.

28
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:26,039
They give me hope.

29
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:34,039
Everything I said was true, apart from that last part.

30
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:39,039
And although the head hurts,

31
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:46,039
the heart knows the truth.
