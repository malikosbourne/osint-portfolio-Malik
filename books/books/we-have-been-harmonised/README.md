## Summary
📖 Book Summary (Neutral / Factual)
We Have Been Harmonised examines how the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) maintains power not only through surveillance and coercion, but through psychological conditioning, language control, and cultural compliance. Strittmatter argues that modern authoritarianism in China functions less through brute force and more through a vast, self-correcting apparatus that encourages citizens to internalise acceptable behaviour.
The book explores the legacy of the Tiananmen massacre, the role of party cadres, ideological flexibility disguised as pragmatism, and how Marxist rhetoric has evolved into a tool for control rather than liberation. Strittmatter frames China’s system as an epochal model of governance, one that blends technological efficiency with deep-rooted indoctrination.

## My Notes & Reflections
This book feels relevant because it dismantles the myth that authoritarianism is always loud, obvious, and violent. What’s unsettling is how normalised control becomes when it is efficient, quiet, and framed as stability.
What stands out most is the idea of harmonisation — not as censorship alone, but as a cultural process. People are not just silenced; they are trained to silence themselves. That resonates deeply with my interest in digital conformity, surveillance culture, and how modern societies drift into compliance without a clear “moment” of collapse.
The parallels to Western systems are uncomfortable. While the CCP operates openly as an autocratic apparatus, many democratic societies are adopting similar tools — data collection, behavioural nudging, algorithmic visibility — but without the same transparency. This book sharpens my instinct to ask who benefits, who controls the narrative, and how language itself becomes a mechanism of power.
