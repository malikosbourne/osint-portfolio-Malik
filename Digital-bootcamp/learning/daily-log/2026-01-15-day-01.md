## 🎯 Session Overview

**Focus Areas:**
- IT Fundamentals
- Cyber Security Principles
- Masters Programs & Policy Making
- People-Centric Approaches
- Process-First Methodology
- AI Tools & Their Implications

> **Core Philosophy:** Process first → Benefits → Tools last (not first)

---

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Process-First Approach

**Fundamental Principle:** Everything is designed to help a process.

```
Process → Benefits → Tools
   ↓         ↓         ↓
Define   Identify   Select
```

**Key Points:**
- ✅ Tools should support processes, not drive them
- ✅ Focus on understanding the workflow before selecting technology
- ✅ Benefits emerge from well-defined processes
- ✅ Technology is the enabler, not the solution

## 🤖 AI Tools & Privacy Concerns

### ChatGPT & Data Security

> ⚠️ **Critical Warning:** When creating CVs with GPT, do NOT include sensitive information.

**Never Include:**
- ❌ Phone numbers
- ❌ Home address details
- ❌ Personal contact information

**Why?**
- Data can be stored, retained, and potentially leaked
- AI services maintain conversation history
- Privacy implications for personal data

**Action Required:**
```bash
# Check what data ChatGPT has retained about you
Search: "your name" in ChatGPT conversation history
```

### Real-World Data Concerns

#### NHS Data Management
- **Issue:** NHS accumulating excessive data
- **Risk:** Creates a "black hole" of possibilities
- **Notable:** Palantir's interest in NHS data systems
- **Concern:** Data governance and privacy implications

#### Police Databases & Evidence
- Lost data issues
- Records management challenges
- CCTV footage storage (pros/cons)
- Evidence preservation concerns
- Data integrity risks
