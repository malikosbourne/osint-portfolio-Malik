# The Can of Coke That Exposed Britain's Selective Health Policy

*How a simple observation revealed corporate marketing psychology and government hypocrisy*

---

I was having a meal the other day when something caught my eye. The can of Coca-Cola that came with my food had no traffic light colours on it. You know, those green, amber, and red indicators that tell you at a glance whether something is high in sugar, fat, or salt.

I thought: *Is this even legal?*

Turns out, it is. And that's the problem.

## The System That Should Be Mandatory (But Isn't)

The UK's traffic light nutritional labelling system—those colour-coded indicators that help us make healthier choices—is completely voluntary. Companies can choose whether to use it or not.

Here's the kicker: since Brexit, the UK government has had the power to make it mandatory. They just... haven't.

Think about that for a second. The government will ban 2-for-1 fizzy drink refills in the name of public health, but they won't force companies to clearly label how much sugar is in their products. It's selective health concern at its finest.

## What I Discovered

When I started digging into this, I found something fascinating. Coca-Cola's relationship with traffic light labelling is a masterclass in corporate marketing psychology.

**2013**: Coca-Cola rejects the traffic light system entirely, preferring their own "Guideline Daily Amount" labels instead.

**2014**: They do a U-turn and commit to using traffic light labels.

**2024**: Some products have the labels, some don't. And when they do include them, they're designed to look as good as possible.

## The "One Red, Three Green" Trick

According to a House of Lords report, when Coca-Cola does use traffic light labels, they typically show **one red and three green** indicators. One red for sugar (obviously), but three greens for everything else. 

This isn't an accident. It's marketing psychology. The visual balance makes the product appear healthier than it actually is. As Dr. Chris van Tulleken noted in the parliamentary report, the system may serve more as a marketing tool than an effective health warning.

## The Label-Less Experiment

Earlier this year, Coca-Cola went even further. They trialled completely label-less Sprite bottles in select Tesco stores. No visible nutritional information at all—just a QR code you'd need to scan with your phone.

They framed it as an environmental initiative (less packaging, easier recycling). But the result? Consumers can't see nutritional information at a glance anymore. You need a smartphone and an internet connection just to know what you're drinking.

## The Numbers We Don't Know

Here's what really gets me: we have no idea how many Coca-Cola products in the UK actually use traffic light labels versus those that don't. The company doesn't publish this data, and there's no requirement for them to do so.

Industry estimates suggest about **one-third of all food products** in the UK don't use the traffic light system at all. But for Coca-Cola specifically? Your guess is as good as mine.

## Why This Matters

This isn't just about a can of fizzy drink. It's about transparency, consumer trust, and the gap between what companies say they're doing and what they're actually doing.

Coca-Cola can claim they're committed to transparency and health-conscious labelling. But when given the choice to be transparent, they're choosing not to be—at least not consistently. Some products get the labels, some don't. Some get labels designed to minimise negative visual cues. Some get no labels at all.

This is what I call "healthwashing": making products appear healthier or more socially responsible than they are, whilst avoiding the full accountability that mandatory labelling would require.

## The Bigger Picture

The UK government has the power to fix this. Post-Brexit, they can mandate traffic light labelling across the board. But they haven't.

Instead, we have a system where:
- Companies can pick and choose which products get clear labelling
- The government takes action on some health issues (like refill bans) but not others (like mandatory labelling)
- Consumers are left guessing about what they're actually consuming

It's selective health policy. And it benefits big corporations whilst leaving consumers in the dark.

## What I'm Doing About It

I've documented this investigation with all the evidence, sources, and findings. You can find the full investigation on my [GitHub portfolio](https://github.com/malikosbourne/osint-portfolio-Malik), including links to parliamentary reports, news articles, and corporate statements.

But here's what I want you to do: **look at the products you buy**. Check if they have traffic light labels. Notice which ones do and which ones don't. Ask yourself: why?

Because when companies are given the choice to be transparent, and they choose not to be, that tells you everything you need to know about their priorities.
