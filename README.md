# OSINT Portfolio — [Your Name]

Welcome to my open-source intelligence (OSINT) and digital verification portfolio.  
I'm exploring how data, ethics, and technology intersect — using real-world examples to test what's true and what's noise.

### 🔍 Focus Areas
- Verification of online images, posts, and claims  
- Ethical AI and digital truth frameworks  
- Data scraping, visualization, and reproducibility  

### 📂 Projects

   → Target: [add short 1-liner, e.g., "Tracing the source of a viral image"]
2. **Mini Investigation #2** — planned (Dec 2025)

### 🧰 Tech Stack
