# OSINT Portfolio — Malik Osbourne

Welcome to my open-source intelligence (OSINT) and digital verification portfolio.  
I'm exploring how data, ethics, and technology intersect — using real-world examples to test what's true and what's noise.

### 🔍 Focus Areas
- Verification of online images, posts, and claims  
- Ethical AI and digital truth frameworks  
- Data scraping, visualization, and reproducibility
