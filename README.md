# OSINT Portfolio — Malik Osbourne

Welcome to my open-source intelligence (OSINT) and digital verification portfolio. I explore how data, ethics, and technology intersect, using real-world investigations to test what's true and what's noise.

## 🔍 Focus Areas

- **Digital Verification**: Verification of online images, posts, and claims
- **Ethical AI Research**: Digital truth frameworks and AI governance
- **Data Analysis**: Scraping, visualization, and reproducible research methodologies

## 📂 Active Projects

### [Digital Conformity Investigation](projects/digital-ID/README.md)
**Status:** In Progress  
An investigation into how digital ID systems, consent frameworks, and safeguarding protocols create systems of control that operate differently from traditional authoritarianism but achieve similar ends.
